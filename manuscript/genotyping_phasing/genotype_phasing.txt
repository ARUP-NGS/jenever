To check the accuracy of predicted genotype and phasing of variants we compared it with the known genotype and phasing info of truth variants in GIAB VCFs. For genotype accuracy, we calculated the accuracy separately for homozygous and heterozygous variants. As shown in the Table X / Figure X, the genotype accuracy for both homozygous and heterozygous variants is well above 0.99. For phasing accuracy, we identified pair of variants that are heterozygous and less than 100 base pair apart and compared their phasing predictions with the known GIAB phasing info. The phasing info in GIAB samples is only available for HG001, HG002 and HG005 cell lines, so we could only use those for our analysis. The combined phasing accuracy for all the identified pairs is also above 0.99.
